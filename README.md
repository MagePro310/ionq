# IonQ Quantum Computing Workspace

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for exploring and experimenting with various quantum computing frameworks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use a different quantum computing library to run quantum circuits and algorithms.

## Notebooks Included

- **cirq.ipynb**: Examples and tutorials using [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq).
- **cudaq.ipynb**: Experiments with [CUDA Quantum (CUDA-Q)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-quantum).
- **pennylane.ipynb**: Demonstrations with [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/).
- **qbraid.ipynb**: Usage of [qBraid](https://www.qbraid.com/) platform and tools.
- **qiskit.ipynb**: Quantum programming with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).
